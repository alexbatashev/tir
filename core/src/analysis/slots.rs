//! Stack-slot classification: which allocations a pass may treat as values.
//!
//! Reading the slots is the question every memory transform asks first — scalar
//! promotion, state threading and the view's memory laws all need to know which
//! allocation a location names and whether its address is observable elsewhere.
//! The reading is interface-driven (`PromotableAllocation`, `MemoryRead`,
//! `MemoryWrite`), so it says nothing about which dialect spells the slot.
